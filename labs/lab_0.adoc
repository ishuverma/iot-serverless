= Lab 0: Lab Environment & Resources

== Setup Lab Environment
This lab utilizes Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform which can be provisioned on-premise or on public cloud, on Open Stack platform, in a VM or natively on operating system, on a multi-cluster system or laptop (using Minishift). Installing OpenShift is outside the scope of this lab.

== Pre-reqs

=== Persistent Storage
In order for IoT data to persist across ephemeral containers, persistent storage needs to be configured for OpenShift. Depending on how OpenShift is provisioned, an appropriate method can be used setup persistent storage.

For this lab, 10 persistent volumes (PV) will be needed (half with 10GB and other half with 5GB). Make sure for each PV the access modes are set to ReadWriteOnce and ReadWriteMany
Change the access permissions and ownership of the persistent volumes so the user can Read/Write/Execute these volumes.

=== Install required packages
- nodejs
- wget
- git
- zip
- oc


== Access Lab environment with OpenShift CLI

OpenShift features a Command Line Interface for interacting with the Platform.

Login to OpenShift using oc command:

[source,bash]
----
oc login <openshift ip address>:8443 +
----

You will see a warning related to insecure certificates. Given that this is a lab environment, it is OK to safely ignore these warnings. Type **Y** and hit Enter.

If successful, you will see the following output:

[source,bash]
----
Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>

Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.
----

The OpenShift CLI has been successfully configured and ready for use in the lab!

Lets grant OpenShift Console user privileges to administer the project from GUI.
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user admin <user>

=== OpenShift Web Console

OpenShift features a rich user interface for managing resources on the platform.

Open a web browser and navigate to the following location

link:https://<openshift ip address>:8443]

Similar to the CLI, a warning will appear stating that insecure certificates are being utilized. Ignore the certificate warning and continue on to the login page.

Once again, use the following credentials at the login page

The OpenShift catalog should be shown upon successful authentication

== Lab Resources

The primary source of content for this lab is the IoT Serverless project repository.

*Project location:* link:https://github.com/sabre1041/iot-serverless[https://github.com/sabre1041/iot-serverless]

Navigate to the `/home/lab-user` folder and clone the lab repository. Once cloned navigate into the `iot-serverless` directory:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd /home/lab-user
$ git clone https://github.com/sabre1041/iot-serverless
