= Lab 2: Deploy MongoDB

== Preparing the Lab Environment

Now that the OpenShift and OpenWhisk tooling have been set up, let’s start to build the solution!

First, create a new project in OpenShift that will be the workspace for the resources being deployed in this lab.

[source,bash]
----
$ oc new-project iot-serverless --display-name="IoT Serverless" --description="Serverless technologies to manage and process Internet of Things (IoT) assets"

Now using project "iot-serverless" on server "https://infranode-<GUID>.generic.opentlc.com:8443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git
----

The iot-serverless project has been created and will be used for the remainder of the lab.

[NOTE]
====
In OpenShift environments using an alternate SDN, such as the `ovs-multitenant` plugin, the networks will need to be joined in order for proper communication to occur.

Execute the following command to join the two networks:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc adm pod-network join-projects --to=openwhisk iot-serverless
----
====

=== Deploying and Populating MongoDB

link:https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB] is a popular non relational database (NoSQL). As asset location data is received, it is stored in MongoDB for retrieval afterward.

OpenShift provides support for MongoDB and includes templates to streamline the deployment.

Execute the following command to instantiate the template which will create a new user and set the password to _iot-serverless_ along with a database called _iotserverless_.

[source,bash]
----
$ oc process -p MONGODB_USER=iot-serverless -p MONGODB_PASSWORD=iot-serverless MONGODB_DATABASE=iotserverless openshift//mongodb-persistent | oc apply -f-

secret "mongodb" created
service "mongodb" created
persistentvolumeclaim "mongodb" created
deploymentconfig "mongodb" created
----

In a few moments, the MongoDB database will be running. +

Confirm that it is running by viewing the list of running pods using the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get pods

NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mongodb-1-x75j8   1/1       Running   0          3m
----

A READY column indicating 1/1 denotes the service is ready and available

To support later portions of the lab, additional information about each asset needs be added. A MongoDB link:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/databases-and-collections/#collections[collection] needs to be populated containing this additional information. To properly seed the database, an link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/dev_guide/jobs.html[OpenShift job] can be used. A job is an OpenShift pod that runs to completion, unlike a ReplicationController which ensures a set number of replicas are constantly running.

A template is available to seed the database and contains the following resources:

* A ConfigMap containing the values to be added to a newly created collection
* A job to execute the link:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongoimport/[mongoinport] command to import the values contained in the ConfigMap

From the root of the project, execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc process -f applier/templates/mongodb-database-seed.yml | oc apply -f-

configmap "mongodb-seed" created
job "mongodb-database-seed-stt8a" created
----

The ConfigMap and Job will be created.

Use the following command to track the state of the job.

[source,bash]
----
$ watch oc get pods
----

When the pod with the name beginning with “mongodb-database-seed” has a status of “Completed”, hit CTRL+C to exit the “watch” command.

[source,bash]
----
NAME                                READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
mongodb-1-x75j8                     1/1       Running     0          2h
mongodb-database-seed-l8lcb-vqc65   0/1       Completed   0          29s
----

Let’s view the data that was added to the database by accessing a remote shell into the mongodb pod using the `oc rsh` command.

Execute the following command which will obtain the name of the running mongodb pod and start a remote shell session.

[source,bash]
----
$ oc rsh $(oc get pods -l=deploymentconfig=mongodb -o 'jsonpath={.items[0].metadata.name}')
----

The DeploymentConfig defining the MongoDB application injects a series of environment variables containing the username, password and name of the primary database. +

Use these environment variables to connect to MongoDB.

[source,bash]
----
$ mongo 127.0.0.1:27017/$MONGODB_DATABASE -u $MONGODB_USER -p $MONGODB_PASSWORD
MongoDB shell version: 3.2.10
connecting to: 127.0.0.1:27017/iotserverless
Welcome to the MongoDB shell.

Previously, we'd used the mongoimport command to create a new collection called _assets_. +

Verify the contents of the collection by executing the following command:

[source,bash]
----
> db.assets.find()

If results were returned, Mongodb has been setup and configured successfully.

Type `exit` to exit out of the mongodb shell.

Type `exit` again to return out of the pod shell.
